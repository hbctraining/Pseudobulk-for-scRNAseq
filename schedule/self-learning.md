#  Pseudobulk and related approaches for scRNA-seq analysis

## Learning Objectives

- Understanding considerations for when to use different DGE algorithms on scRNA-seq data
- Using FindMarkers to evaluate significantly DE genes
- Aggregating single cell expression data into a pseudobulk counts matrix to run a DESeq2 workflow
- Evaluating expression patterns of differentially expressed genes at the pseudobulk and single cell level
- Application of methods for evaluating differential proportions of cells between conditions
